# Top 5 Most Deadly Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters In The US (1990-2022)


## Description

This Python script reads in a dataset called "events_US_1980_2022.csv", which contains information about weather and climate disasters that have caused at least one billion dollars in damage in the United States. It then creates a bar chart that displays the Top 5 most deadly disasters based on the number of deaths caused by each event. The chart is styled using the "fivethirtyeight" theme and includes labels for the bars, a title, and annotations indicating the source of the data and the author of the script. Finally, the chart is saved as a PNG file called "plot.png" with a resolution of 300 dpi and tight bounding box.

## Instructions to Run

### Install necessary libraries: pandas, matplotlib
Save the script as a .py file in the same directory as the "events_US_1980_2022.csv" dataset.
Run the script and the bar chart will be displayed in the console and saved as "plot.png" in the same directory.
